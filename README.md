# How to Deploy Your Website with GitHub Pages

## Steps to Deploy
1. **Go to** [github.com](https://github.com) and **sign up or log in**.
2. **Create a new repository**  
   - Example name: `my-website`
3. **Upload your project files**  
   - Include at least:
     - `index.html`
     - `style.css`
4. **Go to your repository's Settings > Pages**
5. Under **“Source,”** choose:
   - Branch: `main`
   - Folder: `/ (root)`
6. **Click “Save”**

Your website will be live at https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name>
Replace `<your-username>` and `<your-repo-name>` with your GitHub username and repository name.

Note: Any time you push updates to your `index.html` or other files, the site will auto-update within a minute or two.
